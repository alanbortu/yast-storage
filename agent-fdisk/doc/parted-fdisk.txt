Reason for the coexistence of parted and fdisk as partitioning tools
in YaST2. Both tools have advantages and disadvantages so SuSE
decided to not rely exclusively on one of the tools for all available
architectures.

Pro/Cons fdisk

    + wide user base, therefore thoroughly tested
    + allows setting of arbitrary partition id for a partition

    - not able to handle partitioning on Macintosh
    - not able to handle GPT

Pro/Cons parted
    
    + able to do partitioning on Macintosh
    + able to resize partitions and filesystems on partitions
    + able to handle GPT

    - no possibility to set partition id of a plain partition
      (no hibernation partitions for laptops as 0xA0 e.g.)
