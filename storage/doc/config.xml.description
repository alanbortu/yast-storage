Currently there are the following configurable parameters for
partitioning proposal, they are all in the category "partitioning"
if the product features read from file config.xml .

try_separate_home:
    This parameter determines if a separate filesystem for /home should be
    proposed at all.
    Current Value  SL: true     SLES: false      SLED: true

limit_try_home:
    This is the lower limit of available disk space that the code tries to
    create a proposal with a separate filesystem for /home. If for some reason
    less disk space than this is available no separate /home will be proposed.
    Current Value  SL: 5G       SLES: 5G         SLED: 14G

root_space_percent:
    This is the percentage of available disk space to use for the root
    filesystem. With this setting a disk with 20 Gig available space will
    result in roughly 8Gig for root filesystem and 12Gig for /home filesystem.
    Be aware that there are upper and lower limits for root filesystem size
        determined by "root_base_size" and "root_max_size".
    Current Value  SL: 40       SLES: 40         SLED: 40

root_base_size:
    Minimal size of root filesystem if a separate filesystem for /home is to
    be created.
    Current Value  SL: 3G       SLES: 3G         SLED: 3G

root_max_size:
    Maximal size of root filesystem if a separate filesystem for /home is to
    be created. The proposal will not suggest to create a larger root filesystem
    than this limit. Instead it will add the unused space to the filesystem for
    /home.
    Current Value  SL: 10G      SLES: 10G        SLED: 10G

proposal_lvm:
    Determines if a proposal based on LVM is created as default.
    Only one of proposal_lvm and proposal_evms can be set to true.

proposal_evms:
    Determines if a proposal based on EVMS is created as default.
    Only one of proposal_lvm and proposal_evms can be set to true.

vm_desired_size:
    The size the proposal tries to allocate for the volume group if
    it needs to create a new volume group. If a suitable volume group
    is already on the disks this is used and no new volume group is
    created.
    This value is only used if either proposal_lvm or proposal_evms is true.

vm_home_max_size:
    Maximal size of home filesystem if a separate filesystem for /home is to
    be created. The proposal will not suggest to create a larger filesystem
    than this limit. 
    This value is only used if either proposal_lvm or proposal_evms is true.

boot_evms:
    If this is set to true, proposal will use an compatible evms volume like 
    /dev/evms/sda1 for boot partition instead of traditional /dev/sda1.
    This feature is requested for OES installation.
